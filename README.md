## Notes

Creating and appending game cards to the DOM was trickier than I expected at first, improper template literals caused issues with images and text not displaying properly, but I fixed this by adjusting the syntax and ensuring everything was formatted correctly. Filtering games by their funding status also gave me some trouble as I initially used the wrong comparison logic, which led to games being categorized incorrectly, but I reviewed my code and managed to resolve it.
